# London Bike Sharing Data Visualization

## Introduction:
-  This project aims to analyze and visualize the bike sharing data in London using Power BI. By exploring the interactive visualizations, you can gain insights into bike sharing patterns, user behavior, and the impact on urban mobility.

## Project Overview
- In this project, we leverage the Power BI platform to create dynamic visualizations that uncover trends, patterns, and valuable insights from the London bike sharing data. By presenting the data in an intuitive and interactive manner, we aim to make it easy for users to explore and understand the impact of bike sharing on urban mobility.

## Visualization
- The Power BI visualizations in this project provide a comprehensive view of the London bike sharing data. The interactive dashboards allow users to:
    - Rides by Season: To identify the total rides usage of each season
    - Non-holiday Vs Holiday: To find out the relationship of ride usage between holiday and non-holiday
    - Non-weekend Vs Weekend: To find out the relationship of ride usage between weekend and non-weekend
    - Most rides by time: Identify when is the most ride usage in a day
    - Total Rides by Season and Weather: Analyze the correlation between ride usage, seasonal variations, and weather conditions
